# Ikea letter tray mount

## How to build one
* Own an Ikea DOKUMENT letter tray
* Remove the bent sections from the letter tray (where the feet are attached)
* 3d-print this object two times
* Screw the letter tray to the underside of a table of your choice

## How to customize
The only thing worth customizing might be the screw holes. The part is made with OpenSCAD, so you will need:
* [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/), version 2015.03
